we will be performing these activities as part of learning automation 

- Create a S3 bucket
- copy local files to s3 bucket
- Perform some s3 based activities over it via script.
- delete those buckets.

As a DevOps practice, there are several activities you can perform on AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) to support your development and operations workflows. Here are some common DevOps activities related to S3:

Bucket Creation: Create S3 buckets to store objects such as files, logs, backups, or static website content.

Versioning: Enable versioning on buckets to keep track of different versions of objects and enable easy rollback if needed.

Object Uploading: Upload objects (files) to S3 buckets using various methods, such as AWS CLI, SDKs, or directly through the AWS Management Console.

Bucket Permissions: Manage access permissions to S3 buckets using bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control who can read, write, or delete objects.

Bucket Lifecycle Management: Define lifecycle policies to automate the transition of objects between different storage classes (e.g., from standard to Glacier for cost optimization) and to delete or expire objects based on their age or specific criteria.

Data Replication: Configure cross-region replication (CRR) or same-region replication (SRR) to replicate objects from one bucket to another for data redundancy, disaster recovery, or compliance requirements.

Logging and Monitoring: Enable access logging on buckets to track access requests and configure event notifications using Amazon S3 Event Notifications to trigger other actions or services based on specific events (e.g., file upload).

Static Website Hosting: Use S3 to host static websites by enabling the static website hosting feature and configuring appropriate permissions and routing rules.

Backup and Restore: Use S3 as a backup destination for your application data or databases, and implement backup and restore procedures as part of your DevOps practices.

Security and Compliance: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit, configure S3 bucket policies to enforce security best practices, and adhere to compliance requirements, such as HIPAA or GDPR.

These activities can be automated and integrated into your CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts, or configuration management tools to ensure consistent and reliable S3 management as part of your DevOps workflows.
